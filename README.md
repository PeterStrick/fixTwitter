# fixTwitter Bot

[![Connect-Deployment](https://github.com/rsh52/fixTwitter/workflows/run_bot/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rsh52/fixTwitter/workflows/run_bot/actions)

This is a Discord bot that detects X or Twitter links and converts them to fixupx links. It is written in Python and requires a `BOT_TOKEN` equal to the Discord Bot API token.

At the moment this is not hosted on any server, for users who would like to make use of it you will need the `BOT_TOKEN` and to run `main.py` on a machine of your choosing.

You can clone this repo using:

```
gh repo clone rsh52/fixTwitter
```
